This implementation is used for reference ONLY!  Please also note that the TA would check whether your program is too similar to your fellow studentsâ€™ code using **plagiarism detectors** for all assignments. **If you are caught copying others' code, you will get an automatic 0.**

Note that Assignment 2 can also use a pointer array approach. We can implement a map to link each function to a pointer, and whenever a function is required to be called, we use the pointer to call that function.
