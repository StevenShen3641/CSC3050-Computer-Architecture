Assignments implementation of CSC3050 Computer Architecture 2023 Fall.

Assignment 1: 100/100

Assignment 2: 100/100

Assignment 3: 100/100

Assignment 4: 100/100

This implementation is used for reference ONLY!  If you are caught copying others' code, you will get an automatic 0.

Note that Assignment 2 can also use a pointer array approach. We can implement a map to link each function to a pointer, and whenever a function is required to be called, we use the pointer to call that function.
